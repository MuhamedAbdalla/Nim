# Nim
Tags: Data structure - Algorithms - OOP – Math - SFML

○ Nim is a Chinese game that depend on mathematics calculation to win. It consists of chosen number columns each column has number of elements and player can chooses a number from specific column to erase from it.

○ If we figure this, we will find that the only way to try to win is a MEX and Grundy number algorithm. So, using Data structure, OOP, SFML and previous mathematics algorithms. We developed this pretty game.
